Background
The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over the past 30 years. We 
performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person 
spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic.
Methods
We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed 
repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The body-
mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to 
examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his 
or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors.
Results
Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters], ≥30) were present in the network at 
all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These 
clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social 
ties among obese persons. A person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese 
in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the 
chance that the other would become obese increased by 40% (95% CI, 21 to 60). If 
one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become 
obese increased by 37% (95% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neigh -
bors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively 
greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smok -
ing cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network.
Conclusions
Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of 
obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have 
implications for clinical and public health interventions.

Emotional states can be transf e r r e dt oo t h e r sv i ae m o t i o n a l
contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions
without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established
in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and
negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social
network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting
moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through
networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], al-
though the results are controversial. In an experiment with people
who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs
outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing
the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive
expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts
and more negative posts; when negative expressions were re-
duced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that
emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own
emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale
contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in
contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and non-
verbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and
that the observation of others ’positive experiences constitutes
a positive experience for people.
computer-mediated communication |social media |big data
Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional
contagion, leading them to experience the same emotions as
those around them. Emotional contagion is well established in
laboratory experiments (1), in which people transfer positive and
negative moods and emotions to others. Similarly, data from
a large, real-world social network collected over a 20-y period
suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness)
can be transferred through networks as well (2, 3).
The interpretation of this network effect as contagion of mood
has come under scrutiny due to the study ’s correlational nature,
including concerns over misspecification of contextual variables
or failure to account for shared experiences (4, 5), raising im-
portant questions regarding contagion processes in networks. An
experimental approach can address this scrutiny directly; how-
ever, methods used in controlled experiments have been criti-
cized for examining emotions after social interactions. Interacting
with a happy person is pleasant (and an unhappy person, un-
pleasant). As such, contagion may result from experiencing an
interaction rather than exposure to a partner ’se m o t i o n .P r i o r
studies have also failed to address whether nonverbal cues are
necessary for contagion to occur, or if verbal cues alone suffice.
Evidence that positive and neg ative moods are correlated in
networks (2, 3) suggests that this is possible, but the causal
question of whether contagion processes occur for emotions in
massive social networks remains elusive in the absence of ex-
perimental evidence. Further, others have suggested that in
online social networks, exposure to the happiness of others
may actually be depressing to us, producing an “alone together ”
social comparison effect (6).
Three studies have laid the groundwork for testing these pro-
cesses via Facebook, the largest online social network. This researchdemonstrated that ( i) emotional contagion occurs via text-based
computer-mediated communication (7); ( ii) contagion of psy-
chological and physiological qualities has been suggested based
on correlational data for social networks generally (7, 8); and
(iii) people ’s emotional expressions on Facebook predict friends ’
emotional expressions, even days later (7) (although some shared
experiences may in fact last several days). To date, however, there
is no experimental evidence that emotions or moods are contagious
in the absence of direct interaction between experiencer and target.
On Facebook, people frequently express emotions, which are
later seen by their friends via Facebook ’s“News Feed ”product
(8). Because people ’s friends frequently produce much more
content than one person can view, the News Feed filters posts,
stories, and activities undertaken by friends. News Feed is the
primary manner by which people see content that friends share.
Which content is shown or omitted in the News Feed is de-
termined via a ranking algorithm that Facebook continually
develops and tests in the interest of showing viewers the content
they will find most relevant and engaging. One such test is
reported in this study: A test of whether posts with emotional
content are more engaging.
The experiment manipulated the extent to which people ( N=
689,003) were exposed to emotional expressions in their News
Feed. This tested whether exposure to emotions led people to
change their own posting behaviors, in particular whether ex-
posure to emotional content led people to post content that was
consistent with the exposure —thereby testing whether exposure
to verbal affective expressions leads to similar verbal expressions,
a form of emotional contagion. People who viewed Facebook in
English were qualified for selection into the experiment. Two
parallel experiments were conducted for positive and negative
emotion: One in which exposure to friends ’positive emotional
content in their News Feed was reduced, and one in which ex-
posure to negative emotional content in their News Feed was
reduced. In these conditions, when a person loaded their News
Feed, posts that contained emotional content of the relevant
emotional valence, each emotional post had between a 10% and
Significance
We show, via a massive ( N=689,003) experiment on Facebook,
that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional
contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions
without their awareness. We provide experimental evidence
that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction be-
tween people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is
sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.

An Experimental Study of Homophily
in the Adoption of Health Behavior
Damon Centola
How does the composition of a population affect th e adoption of health behaviors and innovations?
Homophily —similarity of social contacts —can increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less
healthy individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding them from interactions
with healthier, more influential, early adopters. As a result, an important network-level effect of
h o m o p h i l yi st h a tt h ep e o p l ew h oa r em o s ti nn e e d of a health innovation may be among the least
likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thes is, confounding factors in observational data have
made it difficult to test empirica lly. We report results from a controlled experimental study on the
spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which the level of homophily was
independently varied. We found that homophily signif icantly increased overall adoption of a new health
behavior, especially among those most in need of it.
Social networks are a primary channel for
the spread of health behaviors ( 1–3). How-
ever, it is not just the existence of social
ties between individuals that matters for diffu-
sion. Just as important are the demographic com-
position of the population and the distribution of
individual characteristics throughout the social
network ( 4–6). Homophily —the tendency of so-
cial contacts to be similar to one another —can
affect the extent of a behavior ’s adoption in a
population ( 7–12). At the dyadic level, research
on diffusion has suggested that homophilous ties
can promote the spread of behavior between
individuals ( 11–13). This is because actors are
more likely to be influenced by alters who are
similar to themselves. However, research on so-
cial influence has also suggested that the effects
of status can interact with those of homophily
(12,14,15). Homophily among high-status
individuals may help to promote diffusion, but
low-status individuals may be more likely to be
influenced by heterophilous ties to high-statusalters than by homophilous ties to similarly low-
status individuals ( 12,15).
Although these accounts of homophily may
be in tension with one another at the dyadic level,
at the network level both views support the the-
sis that homophily will reduce overall adoption,
thereby increasing health inequalities across di-
verse populations ( 12–14,16). This network-
level effect emerges from the fact that homophily
can result in less healthy individuals having fewer
social ties to healthier early adopters, which lim-its their level of exposure to health innovations
(3,7,11,12). Moreover, fewer ties to healthy indi-
viduals also means that the exposure that the less
healthy individuals do receive is less likely to come
from healthier members of the population —who
may be more effective at influencing others to
adopt new behaviors ( 7–11)—thereby reducing the
likelihood of adoption among those less healthy
individuals who are ultimately exposed to the in-
novation ( 15,17).
This network thesis has important implica-
tions for obese members of a population because
the homophilous “clustering ”of health character-
istics in social networks ( 1,3,18,19) can result inobese individuals both receiving less exposure
to valuable health innovations and having fewer
sources of positive social influence, resulting in
lower levels of adoption ( 8,9,16,18). By con-
trast, populations in which obese individuals are
better socially connected to healthier individuals
should provide greater access to health innova-
tions ( 5,6,11,20) and more social support for
adopting new behaviors ( 7,8,16,21), thereby
increasing both overall levels of adoption and the
use of health innovations among the obese
population ( 8,9,21,22).
An empirical test of these individual and
network-level effects of homophily has proven
difficult because homophily in observational data
is usually confounded with other relevant factors
such as the topological structure of social net-
works ( 5,11,23), interpersonal affect in relation-
ships ( 12,24), and shared history and frequency
of interaction among connected individuals
(11,12,24). Moreover, individual-level factors
can be difficult to distinguish from relational
ones: Are obese individuals simply less likely
to adopt a health behavior, or is it their social
environment that reduces their likelihood of
adoption ( 25,26)? Addressing these difficulties
requires the ability to independently control the
degree of homophily in a social network while
simultaneously holding the topology of the net-work, and the distribution of individual- and
population-level parameters, constant.
We addressed these issues by studying the
effects of homophily on adoption experimen-
tally. We conducted an Internet-based social net-
work experiment ( 27) in which we manipulated
the level of homophily in people ’ss o c i a ln e t -
works. Our study focused on the spread of a
health behavior through a World Wide Web social
networking environment composed of 710 par-
ticipants, all of whom were recruited from an
online fitness program ( 28). We constructed two
types of online social networking communities:
(i) homophilously structured populations, in which
